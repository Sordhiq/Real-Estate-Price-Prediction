Wazobia Real Estate Limited is a prominent real estate company operating in Nigeria. With a vast portfolio of properties, they strive to provide accurate and competitive pricing for houses. However, they have been facing challenges in accurately predicting the prices of houses in the current market. To overcome this hurdle, I am developing a robust predictive model for Wazobia Real Estate Limited.

By leveraging real estate dataset, I am analyzing various factors that impact house prices, identify meaningful patterns, and build a model that can generate reliable price predictions. The ultimate goal is to provide Wazobia Real Estate Limited with an effective tool to make informed pricing decisions and enhance their competitiveness in the market.
